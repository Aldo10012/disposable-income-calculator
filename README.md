## Description

Disposable Income Calcuator provides details on your taxes (Federal, FICA, & State) based on your income, location, and filling status, and also provides your disposable income, or how much money you take home post taxes.

### Motivation

As a young adult, there are many things about the real world I have to learn; one major such topic is money and finances. Iâ€™ve always known that working earns you money, but I only recently learned how taxes work. Upon further investigation, I was surprised to see just how much money the government taxes people. This got me curious, how much money do I actually take home? How much money do I really make each month/year? How should I budget?
